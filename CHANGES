1.2.6
        - Added support for:
	    - packet payload (string)
            - user can specify ascii character to fill payload with initially
            - icmp sequence numbers
	    - icmp maximum transfer units
	    - icmp gateway address
	    - igmp group address
	    - timeout for streamed showers
	    - /etc/services

        - -v is now for verbose output (-V and --version for version info)
        - Changed output format to look more professional
        - Added more help options
	- Improved error checking, offering solutions for common errors
        - Fixed bugs in internet checksumming
	- Altered header formats, allowing rain to compile on *BSD platforms

	- Various code tweaks and minor bug fixes

	- Added non-root functionality, including 
	  non-root --help menu.
	- Added --stream, --connect, --seq and --ack-seq options
	- Default source IP is now 127.0.0.1 (Specify -s 0 for random IP)
	- Added normal UDP shower for non-root users
	- _Alot_ of code tweaking		

1.2.4
	- Changed --id-of to work with all protocols, rather than souly IGMP
	- Added -p (same as --sport)
	- Fixed some minor bugs that would not allocate packetsize correctly
	- Now uses global buffer (to avoid memory leaks)
