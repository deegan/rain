1) Add support for a packet-config file, which rain will read from as opposed
to the command line. The format will be something like:

s:spoof_this_host.com
t:some_other_host.com
icmp
icmp-type:0
icmp-code:0


Let mystic@tenebrous.com know what you think abut this idea. Thanks.


2) Add ability to send multiple packets of varying types, wether by splitting the command
line options with a + to specify another packet, or the config file (TODO #1)

3) ARP support and other non-IP support
