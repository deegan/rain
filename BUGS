Known bugs
----------

Linux:
-----
In Linux, kernel 2.4.6, rain will not operate properly if the fragment offset
is set to anything other than 0. This is thought to be a bug in the kernel, and
not rain. (This is one of the many problems I've discovered in 2.4.6)



BSD:
----
For some unknown reason, FreeBSD 4.3 is not allocating the proper amount of bytes
for the packet's buffer, resulting in a "Message Too Long" error.
