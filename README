This is not my code originaly. I am merely trying to update it.

rain-1.3.0
First release that compiles on modern systems.

Code base was rain-1.2.9beta1, updated to 1.3.0

-------------------------------------------------------------

rain is a packeting tool  used for testing system stability.
Do not abuse it.

1 - Installation

	Please see INSTALL

-------------------------------------------------------------

2 - Things to remember

  - The only IP options that can be customized with streamed
    packets are the TOS and TTL

  - When sending an IGMP membership query,
    the --icmp-code specifies the "Max response time"

  - If the destination address contains "255", it is automatically
    assumed to be a broadcast address. (Will have no negative effect)

3 - Q&A

Q: WHY WRITE SUCH A MALICIOUS PROGRAM?

A:   rain is not by any means intended to be used maliciously.
  As with many stability testing programs, it can be abused by
  users that do not mind violating federal law and facing the severe
  consequences of their actions.

    rain was created to test stability of hardware and software.
  Let's say you wanted to see how your router would react if you
  sent it an ICMP packet with Type 3, Code 11, ToS 0x24, window size 56,
  TTL 255 and an invalid fragment offset. That is where rain comes in.
  Rain allows you to create your own, customized packets without the hassle  
  of writing proprietary programs.

   rain is free. If you do not agree with its purpose, simply disregard any
  references to it in the future. I cannot control the morality of mankind.
